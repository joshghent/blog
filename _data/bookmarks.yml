    Time is such a basic premise with so much nuance affected by the physical
    world. Not only is the digital world we create so fragile but also the
    physical world is so abstract to hide these incredibly complexities

  notes: "Wonderful article. I echo all the sentiments. Most software is drab to use because it’s numerical, or factual. But it doesn’t have to be that way. The web can be whimsical!\r\n\r\nGreat quote:\r\n\r\nGeorgia O’Keefe put it this way: \"I have things in my head that are not like what anyone has taught me... so I decided to start anew.\""

    “What uncle Alex found objectionable about so many human beings is that they
    so seldom noticed it when they were happy,” Vonnegut said.


    His uncle made a habit of noticing the good times: When Vonnegut and his
    family would be drinking lemonade under a tree on a summer day, his uncle
    would suddenly exclaim, “Wait a minute, stop! If this isn’t nice, I don’t
    know what is!”

    Daily stand-ups are a classic example of learned helplessness. We all know
    they’re useless, but we tell ourselves “that’s just how things are” and do
    nothing...

    Prioritise going through the backlog and adjusting according to any
    blockers.

    Stand ups are not about making sure people are working, they should be
    focused on getting things done and delivering software to the customer.

    Leisure gives the scribe the chance to acquire wisdom; a man with few
    commitments can grow wise. How can the ploughman become wise, whose sole
    ambition is to wield the goad, driving his oxen, engrossed in their work,
    his conversation limited to bullocks, his thoughts absorbed in the furrows
    he traces and his long evenings spent in fattening heifers?


    Sirach 38: 24-26
