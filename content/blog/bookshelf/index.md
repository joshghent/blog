description: All the books I own
---

I believe reading and travel are the best ways to expose yourself to new ideas. Travelling can be expensive. So, largely I "travel" (through time and space) through the books I read.

Here is a semi-complete list of the books I own. I have lent many to friends and family and donated others. I prefer to have at least 80% of my books unread. I only keep a book I've read if I am going to re-read it or use it for reference later.

I've highlighted good books in <span style="color:blue">blue</span>, and great books in <span style="color:orange">orange</span>. These recommendations are contextual though. At one time, a certain book might be life changing, but at another time be meaningless.

This page will be updated as I get new books. Send me recommendations!
