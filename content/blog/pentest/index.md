Recently, [Koru](https://joinkoru.com) had a penetration test done by an independant third party. The actual test took place a little before I had joined but the results only came in afterwards. Having never read through a pentest report, I was curious to see what they would find and more importantly how. Having been listening to copious amounts of DarkNet Diaries, I thought we were in for something along the lines of "we have all your data and locked you out" level of intrusion.

Thankfully, that wasn't the case. Instead we got a 6 page report outlining the findings. Being fairly unfamiliar with the system at the time (it was literally my first week), it was interesting to gain the insights that the document provided.
Reflecting on it now, it's not incredibly surprising, we use a set of very tight VPC's to seperate each clients data and the only frontend exposure is on a static website; So there are no chances of XSS attacks.

The first discovery which was considered Number 1 priority turned out to be rather humorous. It was discovered that the API returned an "X-Powered-By" header (which tells the client what library or language the service is written in) of "PHP 5.1".
I was a bit puzzled by this as the entire stack was Javascript or Python. After some digging I discovered the following code in the Express server declaration.

```
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
	res.header('X-Powered-By', 'PHP 5.1');
	next();
});
```

** ILLUSION 100 **

This was a sneaky tactic... and very funny. This got removed to not return an X-Powered-By header at all.
