I have been working as a software engineer for 8 years. Over the past 2 years, I've been freelancing for startups, enterprises and everything in between.

The next stage of my business is pivoting away from pure freelancing work to a more complete offering of products and services.

## TL;DR
I launched a business 24 months ago chiefly to work as a freelancer. I'm now looking to diversify and offer a broader suite of products and services to businesses.
These include:
* üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cloud architecture and optimisation
* ‚öôÔ∏è Hands-software development
* üåÖ Engineering leadership, management and training

## What I (now) offer

The key to any successful business is bringing the maximum amount of value to customers. This one is, thankfully, no different. I've chosen 3 key areas where I believe my skills and experience can make a difference.

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cloud architecture and optimisation
Having worked as a software engineer for over 8 years, I've come across every type of cloud architecture imaginable. I've successfully transformed monolithic applications into microservices, migrated applications from on-premise to the cloud and optimised cloud infrastructure to save money.

When I work with any organisation, I focus on the following four pillars (in priority order):
1. **Observability.** Helping organisations to get a handle on the numbers behind their products and developers to gain insight into their code. Having worked with a number of different observability tools, I can help organisations to choose the right one for them.
2. **Reliability.** The only thing worse than an app that is slow is an app that is down. I help organisations to design, build and ship robust products that can scale as the business grows.
3. **Performance.** Application speed is a feature and competitive advantage. Taking a holistic view, I can provide indepth insights into your applications performance and work with your team to improve it.
4. **Cost.** No one wants an AWS bill that leaves you sobbing uncontrollably in a corner. I can help bring confidence and restore consistency to your cloud spend. I approach this by looking at the other three pillars and optimising them to reduce costs.

Generally, my approach is simple, I work with you to understand your business and goals. And then I build you a plan to achieve them by means of the technology you're building.
I don't recommend a one-size-fits-all approach or that you need to hire a giant devops team to manage your infrastructure.
I believe that the best solutions are the simplest ones and I work with you to find the right solution for your business.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Hands-software development

I've spent the past 8 years working directly with code. My areas of expertise are back-end development (particularly API's and event-driven microservices) and infrastructure (particularly serverless). And I've extensively worked with both greenfield and legacy projects.

I've worked with lots of different languages and frameworks, but generally favour these stacks:

#### Stack 1
* *Frontend*: React/Next.js, TailwindCSS, TypeScript
* *Backend*: Node.JS, Typescipt
* *Datastore*: DynamoDB, S3, SQS
* *Infrastructure*: AWS, SST, Cloudflare Pages

#### Stack 2
* *Frontend*: Laravel
* *Backend*: PHP/Laravel
* *Datastore*: PostgreSQL, Redis
* *Infrastructure*: Render.com, Cloudflare

The skills listed above are not exhaustive. I'm always happy picking up new technologies and languages as required.

Software development goes beyond just coding. I take pride in producing robust code, complemented by concise documentation, and prioritize clear communication with both technical and non-technical individuals.

### üåÖ Engineering leadership, management and training

Encompassed within many of my roles is leadership and training. I believe I can help your organisation to train, and retain your engineers - and build a thriving engineering culture in the process. To do this, my approach focuses on

* Creating *systems* that empower the team to drive their own growth.
* Introducing *fair and accurate metrics* to motivate the team and measure progress.
* Building a culture of sharing and learning by introducing *knowledge shares*, *pair programming* and *code reviews*.
* Establishing *psychological safety* by means of *blameless postmortems*, *retrospectives* and *one-to-ones*.
* Making sure that communication between stakeholders and the team is *transparent* and *effective*, with shared goals and values.

I have primarily worked with engineering teams who have a headcount of 1-20 people and successfully introduced these practices to them.
