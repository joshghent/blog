Scheduling time with friends and family is even more critical nowadays. But I’ve noticed a trend that goes something like this:
```
“We should get together some time”
“Yeah when is good for you”
“I’m easy, when works for you”
“I’m easy too, could we do a weekday afternoon”
“Urrmm, I can’t do Tuesday and Thursday afternoons”
```

You get the idea...
I'm sure you've all had conversations like that. We're all guilty of doing this. And what results? Nothing. Arrangements don't get made. In 6 months time, you might send or receive a message that says "oh we never did this? Are you free soon?" and thus, the cycle continues.

But how could we make it better?
```
“Hey we should get together to play some games, how does Friday at 7 sound?”
“Sounds great but can’t do then, shall we say Saturday at 7?”
“Done deal”
```

So much better. Why?
1. 📆 You aren’t left guessing about the other's calendar
2. 🙊 Less messages mean you’re more likely to actually book something in.
3. 🤝 You are both assured of the others commitment to schedule something
