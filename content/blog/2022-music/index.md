In the past couple of years, I started tracking albums I listened to and what I rated them. The motivation was to be able to re-discover music in coming years and to satisfy my tendency to record data about little things.

Here is my list of albums I listened to in 2022. Note that a lot of the albums didn't come out in 2022, just that I listened to them in 2022.

Feel free to drop me recommendations.
