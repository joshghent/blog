Recently, I handed my notice in to my previous job at CloudCall after recieving an new offer at Capp&Co. I won't go into _why_ I chose to leave, but handing my notice in did leave me with the challenge of how to uncouple myself as a Developer and the services that I managed. Jamie Tanna has suggested using blogs as a form of documentation, which is exactly what this is, everything you need to do before you leave your job - broken down by time. In my case I had just under 30 days to get everything ready.

## Take Stock
What products do you own? What does everyone always come to you for? Think about these things

## Payslips
Download archive if you do not get them paper based

## Write documentation
Start way before you even have the intention to leave
Document blogs and log problems you get and their solutions

## Final release
If you don't do CD then deploy all services you manage alongside the person(s) who are taking it over

## Uncouple Accounts
Github, Gitlab, Npm, 2FA, Jenkins/CI, AWS, Email from phone etc, Deleting Google account and removing iCloud from Mac
IFTTT rules

## Logging out
View all passwords stored in Chrome, check there is nothing you need

## Security
Revoke GPG keys or change email on them, remove ssh keys etc.

## Take home personal belongings

## Lessons for the future
Don't link personal and work accounts at all (at least not something without an organisation model like Github)
