Why I practise my typing everyday

Recently, I've started practising my typing each day - for around 5-10 minutes. So far, according to 10fastfingers, I've increased my typing speed from 70WPM to 80WPM. Not much, but I can feel myself getting more "familiar" with the keyboard.

## How?

In the past, I've taken typing tests and got around the 70 mark. But, I was watching an old Day9 video (A Starcraft 2 personality) typing at a ridiculous pace. Having played Starcraft in the past, I was familiar with players 
Principly, I'm doing this by means of a daily typing test on 10fastfingers.com and practise on keybr.com.
Both of these tools differ in key ways (no pun intended).

### 10FastFingers

10FF, gives you a 200 word typing test and a time limit of a minute. The challenge is to type as many words as you can within that period. The words chosen are the most frequently used in English.
I like taking this test regularly because it builds my muscle memory for common words and phrases. Given that you can learn 800 words and know how to speak 75% of a spoken language, it pays to be able to type these common words quickly. I'm ok with taking a couple of seconds to type verismilitude - however much I love that word.
There are a bunch of social features with 10FF, but I don't personally care for these. My only opponent is myself. Often, I catch myself in this test in a sort of "flow" where I magically type all the correct keys without even thinking about it. This momentary realisation makes me smile, but soon turns into scowls when I misstype "soccer" as a result.

### Keybr.com

Keybr is a beautifully designed tool that first takes you through the entire keyboard to see where your weaknesses lie. Most of the words are "riffs" on familiar words - "influencecapa", "comprom" and "discuse". In doing so, it breaks your muscle memory and forces you to think carefully about where you place your fingers.
This tool makes up the bulk of my practise as it "moves" you around the keyboard in a way that typing common words won't.
