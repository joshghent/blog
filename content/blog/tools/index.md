Software development is like every other profession, we have tools. For a craftsmen, it's a fine chisel, for a electrician it's a screwdriver - everywhere you look there are tools.

And as with everything, there is a "top of class" set of tools that the industry leaders use. For example, many builders swear by either Makita tools. Perhaps there is not one correct answer but nonetheless, a lot of effort goes into find the best tool for their job.

Recently, I have been evaluating the tools I was using. As with many developers, I had never had the motivation to look at the endless configurations and understand them. Mostly, I had just copied other peoples dotfiles.
The reason for this work is that I felt to advance to the "next level" I had to upgrade my tools and make sure my workflows were tip top. Those sound like "airy" words but I will go into gritty detail in this article.
