Software development is like every other profession, we have tools. For a craftsmen, it's a fine chisel, for a electrician it's a screwdriver - everywhere you look there are tools.

And as with everything, there is a "top of class" set of tools that the industry leaders use. For example, many builders swear by either Makita tools. Perhaps there is not one correct answer but nonetheless, a lot of effort goes into find the best tool for their job.

Recently, I have been evaluating the tools I was using. As with many developers, I had never had the motivation to look at the endless configurations and understand them. Mostly, I had just copied other peoples dotfiles.
The reason for this work is that I felt to advance to the "next level" I had to upgrade my tools and make sure my workflows were tip top. Additionally, I was driven by re-reading David Allens timeless "Getting Things Done" book. In it, Allen suggests listing all the annoyances you have about your work, home, car - all those nags that you never fully made the time to resolve or bothered to write down. Out of this sprung the thought that I should be working "smarter" not "harder" so to speak. 

Those sound like "airy" words but I will go into gritty detail in this article.

## Terminal
* Bash to ZSHalthough modified the UI
* Stuck with iTerm - 
* Shell aliases - suggested using zsh-autosuggestions

## Code
* VSCode (with _ALL_ the plugins)
* Automated linting
* Global gitignore
* Continuous deployment

### Newsletters
Newsletters seem like quite archaic technology nowadays, but they are insanely valuable to me for staying up to date at my own pace. I've signed up for a number including Last week in AWS, Serverless weekly, Postgre weekly, Node weekly and Morning Paper, among others. They allow me to keep up to date without constantly checking Hacker News and the like. If they start to stack up, I just delete them. I don't let past issues or last weeks news burden me with FOMO. I read what I can and delete the rest. Reading takes up a large percentage of my "learning" time I dedicate each week. I get these emails sent to my work email as they provide something to do if I've got a spare 5 minutes or if I'm having a bit of a low-energy hour. I used to get a myriad sent to my personal email, but they did more harm than good as I would see 20+ emails in my inbox that I had to process after the working day. Reading them during work time makes a lot more sense.

## Misc

### Keyboard Shortcuts
For my first 10+ years of using a computer now, I've always been someone who gravitated towards terminals rather than UI's but I mostly kept one hand on the mouse and never become the l33t hacker that I often saw around offices using their keyboard to do literally anything and everything. I concluded that most of my work was web-based (in JIRA or email etc) and so keyboard shortcuts could not provide me any benefit anyway! Thankfully, I was wrong. Most good enterprise software now has a bunch of shortcuts and a handful of which will serve 99% of usage.

I had a few that stood out to me:
* "M" to add a comment on a JIRA ticket.
* Ctrl + N in Outlook for a new EMail
* Ctrl + D to split the pane in iTerm2
* Ctrl + K to bring up the search panel in Slack so you can switch to a new conversation or channel
* "C" to create a new ticket in JIRA

* Gmail Filters
* Gmail Folders
* Todoist filters


## Hardware

### Keyboard
Despite my desire to use a mechanical keyboard, after many "trial" periods with them, my wrists just won't allow it. Ever since I had carpel tunnel caused by one to many unhealthy marathon sessions of Starcraft, mechanical keyboards require too much actuation force and key travel. Sure there are things to relieve these traits but ultimately will never be as soft as a Magic Keyboard (which I use at work) or the Logitech K380 (which I use at home). Additionally, in both cases, I love the fact that they are wireless as this frees my desk from yet more cables. The Logitech in particular becomes useful since it has 3 bluetooth "profiles" allowing you to switch between devices - in my case between my Macbook and my Windows PC. The switching works flawlessly and would be a feature I would honestly miss on a mechanical keyboard. That's how I'm justifing it to myself anyway
