Technology is so fast paced that to stay up to date, you *need* to be learning on a daily basis. However, the internet is so awash with vast swaths of information of varying accuracy and importance that it's difficult to filter the signal from the noise and only consume that which will be of lasting importance.

This was a challenge that I faced myself in my career of staying up to date and learning about new technologies in a 80/20 fashion. In otherwords, what is the 20% of content I can read for 80% of the impact.

## Why is "staying up to date" important though?

Recently, Corey Quinn, writer of Last Week in AWS, had an interesting point when answering the question of [*"What's the most consistently wrong thing you see AWS users do?"*](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/aws-billing-is-broken-and-kubernetes-wont-last-says-irreverent-economist-corey-quinn/?ck_subscriber_id=559247293)

> *Quinn*: The most consistent mistake that everyone makes when using AWS—this extends to life as well—is once people learn something, *they stop keeping current on that thing*. There is an entire ecosystem of people who know something about AWS, with a certainty. That is simply no longer true, because capabilities change. Restrictions get relaxed. Constraints stop applying. If you learned a few years ago that there are only 10 tags permitted per resource, you aren't necessarily keeping current to understand that that limit is now 50.

I've found this to be true in my own career that often, there will be a workaround I have to do for a particular project but then a new strategy will be released that means we do not need to do that do that workaround anymore. Without, "staying up to date" I would keep doing this workaround!

## The challenge remains however, that you cannot consume or read everything that is published, even about a specific technology. So how can you filter the signal vs noise?


### Subscribing to newsletters
First and foremost, subscribe to these on your work email. Learning is a part of your work and so reading through information on a work relevant topic should be considered as such. Previously, I subscribed to them on my personal email and found myself with a mountain of emails I should have read through on my way home from work.

I find newsletters a great source of learning because they usually contain summaries of articles and only include on the list of articles, ones that particularly stood out with importance.

There is even a newsletter for HackerNews so you can have it boiled down as a sort of "Greatest Hits" of the week. This helps you feel connected to the community without having to spend all day scrolling on there.

### Join Slack/Discord Communities focused around a technology or topic

### Go to Meetups

### Follow relevant people on Twitter (+ setup Twitter mute keywords)

### Listen to Podcasts (selectively) and Books

### Relax
... you don't need to be learning all the time. Although important, you should not overwhelm yourself with media to consume on a near constant basis. That is why I chose to not include tools like Pocket in this article. For myself, they led to massive FOMO and anxiety around how many articles I had stacking up. I read hundreds of articles previously, and truth be told, I remember almost none of them. What I do remember however, is books. For me, they provide much deeper insights and introduce new world views that allow me to learn in new ways.

I have set myself the provision that if a tab is open for more than 10 days, then even if I think it might be the greatest piece of literature ever written, then I close the tab. You have to reason, if it is that good, you'll probably hear about it by some other means.
