Recently, I've been listening to DarkNet Diaries, which has piqued my interest in personal security. It's also made me look into ethical hacking courses and qualifications so I can further improve my development skills - but that's for a seperate blog post.

Personal security and privacy is a subject, which if asked, any sane person would say they care deeply about. Yet seldom to people, including myself, give any real thought to it. I realised I had accrued a tidal wave of accounts, services and passwords, all that had featured in data breaches on HaveIBeenPwned. I remembered all the old phpBB forums that probably stored passwords in plaintext which contained the same passwords that I used for other newer services. Additionally, I'd had someone use my email address to sign up to Instagram and Ubisoft - the emails were not verified and I swiftly deleted those fake accounts but it seemed like pointless work that could easily be avoided.

Additionally, in the "Big Five" controlled world that we live in, I have become increasingly more aware of privacy that I am giving up for the sake of convience. Gmail, Drive, Amazon Prime, Instagram (now Facebook), Whatsapp (also Facebook) and the like. I recently got a Google Home Mini to use with the Hue lights but it irkes me everyday in light of news that employees and random contractors listened to everything it hears.

I wanted to share my experience because there are a lot of "extreme" personal security blogs or tutorials that act as if you are a nation state whistleblower. I don't need that level of privacy - I should, but I don't and that's a conscience desicion I have made - you will need to define where your line is too. The article that follows is more of a "how to stay private but still be able to use the internet sanely" guide.

Future plans
This is all the stuff I don't have time for and has diminishing returns
