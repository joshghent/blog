As software developers we spend far too long at our desks. To solve this many have opted for standing desks, treadmill desks or, in Stephen Wolframs case, a mobile work station mounted on him. Generally speaking though, sitting desks aren't going away. Although I've started to exercise on a daily basis, I wanted to have these mini-exercises that I could perform from my desk and exercise different parts of my body that weren't the major muscles (biceps, triceps, calves etc). Here is a short deskercise routine you can perform at any time.

1. Kiss the Sky

2. Eye see you

3. Arm Circles

4. Breath

5. Wings

6. Neck
