This is a bit non-technical in nature so I may just leave this in drafts but I wanted to write something short about my experience of quitting alcohol for 30 days.
Although 30 days may not seem like anything major, going from 3-5 drinks in a given week to 0 was a big change. I was and have never been a heavy drinker but, as we all do, succumbed to a glass of wine in the evenings more often than not.

It has been fairly well documented how negatively alcohol can affect your weight, sleep and other biological factors. I also read about giving your body a "break" from processing alcohol. I did not do extensive research on this, I'll admit, but the basic idea was that your kidneys needed a little chill out once in a while - bless 'em.
Although that sounded about as scientific as reiki healing, it sounded conceptually interesting and I wanted to experiment on myself to see if it would actually change anything about me.

Here's what I found

1. Winding down in the evenings was a lot harder
Whilst I smuggly drank my lime and tonic for the first 3 nights, afterwards the novelty wore off and I found it incredibly hard to unwind after a day at work. I have always struggled with this, with or without alcohol. But the lack of any form of "relaxing agent" made this process take a lot longer. I believe this was partially due to not having a seperation between work and life. I have been a remote worker for around 5 months now (pre-lockdown) and have always been good about keeping a schedule, always being dressed and not working anywhere apart from my office. However, I believe somewhere in my brain I associated alcohol or at least a glass of wine with "work is over". And by "work is over" I mean, I wasn't going to be doing any more work of any kind, cooking, cleaning, personal life admin, you name it - not just my day job. To draw a very flakey and unscientific conclusion to this, it meant that my body was still in sort of a "there's stuff to be done" mode, meaning I never fully unwound. This resulted in...

2. Going to bed a lot later
Many have reported that giving up alcohol sort of reset their body clock, I found that it did the opposite for me. Due to my mind racing, I struggled to drift off even when extremely tired. I'd have to drown out whatever music I had on that day, that was still playing in my head with podcasts or audiobooks.

3. Health Benefits
Again, despite many claiming they felt magically healed after taking a break from alcohol, personally, I didn't. Any effect I did perceieve would have been entirely ungrounded and most likely a placebo. As I never drank any high calorie beverages like beer, weight loss was probably never going to be an effect I saw. In any case, I didn't find myself feeling any different.

4. No alcohol alternatives to beverages are lacking
There is a huge lack of no alcohol alternatives to alcoholic beverages. There are tonnes of 0% beers or even wines but generally they all taste foul and are a poor imitation of the real thing. I chose not to drink anything like this to really test if I was addicted in even a small way to alcohol. To me, it felt like taking morphine to get over heroin addiction. But that's just me.

5. I thought about alcohol a lot the first week
The first week was actually a lot tougher than I expected. I thought a lot about alcohol, even during the day. It showed me I must have been addicted in a sense because my body was clearly craving it in some form or fashion. This could have been down to me thinking about the fact I couldn't drink and therefore thinking about drinking.

As with all things, it's ok just not in excess. I will still avoid alcohol during the week but I won't be religious about it.
