I've been self-employed for the best part of 2 years now. It's been an interesting ride so far and I hope it will just get better. This "version 2" of the business is the next steps on that journey. I wanted to document it here for historical reasons.

## TL;DR

I launched a business 24 months ago chiefly to work as a freelancer. I'm now looking to diversify and offer a broader suite of products and services to businesses.
These include

- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cloud architecture and optimisation
- üåÖ Engineering leadership, management and training
- ‚öôÔ∏è Hands-software development

## How it started

Having been a software engineer for 6 years (at the time) the logical place to start a business was through freelance contracts. At the time, the market was plentiful and I soon had contracts coming at me from all different directions.

But, recently I've realised two things

1. The contract market has drastically reduced in size (due to various economic factors).
2. My business is still tied to me and my time.

I can't address the first issue, but I can the latter.

So here's the plan...

## Going forward

As stated, my goal is to provide a wider range of products and services for businesses. That may sound like a lot of vague jargon (and it is), but the jist is that I won't be just a software developer - I'll be a cloud architect, teacher, team leader, devops engineer, and software engineer all rolled into one. Additionally, with SaaS products that I've built, I can also offer these free of charge to my clients.
