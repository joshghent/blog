I hate rating things because they are meaningless.

The "Five star" rating system is, in principle, a good idea.

Five stars is meant to be fantastic. One star meaning you are fortunate to tell the tale.

But people want to only be the best and have the best. So 5 stars becomes the "okay", and 1 star means truly awful (or occasionally a vendetta).

So you go about your day thinking "a taxi ride, I better give it 5 stars. I'm alive aren't I?" or "just checked out the airbnb, it was great! 5 stars! There were no rats, so who am I to complain?".

Uber is a classic example of the extreme of this. It's so bad that Uber drivers get booted off the platform if their rating goes below 4.2! If you do dare rate below 5 stars, Uber asks you what was wrong. In my mind, 3 stars means you got me there safely and alive. 5 stars is that
