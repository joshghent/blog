Life can often seem like we don't have enough hours in the day. The media glorifies many who work 80+ hours a week. And there is an attitude that if you're not launching a startup and earning 5k MRR, then you're not doing it right.

I wrestle with the thought that I'm not doing "enough". I should be building another business, growing my client base, writing, or creating videos.

Like many, I have read countless articles and watched numerous videos on "productivity". With the goal of getting more tasks done.

But, I'm trying to talk myself around to the idea, that there will **always be more to do.**

No matter how much you prioritize, refine or cut, there will always be another feature to add, bug to squash or email to reply to. **And that's ok.**

That isn't to say prioritization and refinement are worthless. But it's a fallacy to think this will leave you feeling like your work can ever be "complete".

Instead, try to live slowly. Accept that there will be stuff that doesn't get done.

But in the moment, be happy about what you're doing, and live so that at the end of each day you're pleased with what you've done (not ticked off a list).
