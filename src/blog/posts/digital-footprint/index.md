title: Being Mindful about my Digital Footprint

For better and for worse, I'm a child of the internet age. I grew up here.

And as with others, I have accrued a huge amount of online accounts over the years. Most of these are unused, but I realised the other day how many services I still use.

There are the main ones

1. This blog
2. GitHub
3. Twitter
4. LinkedIn
5. Email

But there is also a bunch of "shadow" services that I use to support other areas of my life.

1. Telegram
2. Slack
3. Notion
4. Todoist
5. Vercel
6. Xero
7. Cloudflare
8. Stripe
9. Uptimerobot
10. Spotify
11. Hacker news
12. Rescuetime
13. Apple notes
14. Typora
15. WhatsApp
16. Amazon
17. iCloud
18. 1Password
19. Indiehackers
20. Google Drive
21. Netflix

It might not be as many as others. But for me, it's a lot. A lot to manage, pay for and update.

I'm on a journey to simplify my life. And my digital world is part of that. This part is especially tricky as I do a job that ultimately hinges on digital services.

The question is, what do I want? What tools do I want to use?

Rather than thinking about these tools individually, it would likely be better to look at categories.

- Notes
  - Just use apple notes. Ditch the rest.
- Communication
  - Just use whatsapp, ditch the rest.
- Business
  - Xero - accounting
  - Stripe - invoicing and subscriptions
  - Vercel - hosting
  - Cloudflare - DNS
  - Uptimerobot - monitoring
  - GitHub - source control
- Storage
  - iCloud - for apple photos
  - Google Drive - for everything else
- Productivity
  - Todoist - used this for years and best tool I've found - may move to reminders if that gets better.

Everything else I can have other solutions for. For example, I can get rid of Typora and just use the Github Web UI or VSCode.

### About social media

The prevailing wisdom is that to build digital products you need to be engaged with Twitter, LinkedIn, Indiehackers etc. And recently, I've also felt the pull to Instagram again because it has content that I enjoy and I have a pull to share some of my photography (although I don't have an account). These platforms all have different target groups - great if you only fit into one of those, bad if you fit into a couple.

Twitter is my most used (and only real) social media platform. Sometimes it's enjoyable and has some good content and ideas. But a lot of the time it's a lot of clickbait threads, and humble bragging. LinkedIn is similar. Lots of bragging, boring job updates, and robotic photos of people at weird award ceremonies. But in both cases, it's sort of "assumed" that you have to have these things.

But this isn't a minimalist way of viewing things (or at least my way). If I don't find value in it, then of what benefit is it to keep it around?

#### Why not just log out?

The obvious to these services is to just log out of them. Out of sight, out of mind? Sort of. But to me, digital clutter is like physical. Sure you can shove it in the garage and never see it, but you _know_ it's there. Deletion is the only way to completely alleviate that.

Going forward I'm going to:

- Log out of LinkedIn and set a reminder to delete it within the next 6 months.
- Delete services I no longer use. Think about which I want to use and get value from.
- Unsubscribe from all emails. Push any communication to Whatsapp or Twitter.
