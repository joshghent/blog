The Anti-book book club started as an excuse to meet with friends every month or two. I wanted to document what the idea was and how it worked.

Regular book clubs all chose a single book to talk about.
There are a few disadvantages to this though:
1. It doesn't cater to personal preferences on the book
2. You all need to buy the same book

By contrast, the anti-book book club is where we all chose a different book but around a central theme.
This has a few advantages
1. Get to share insights from multiple books and different perspectives
2. Trade books after
3. Books cater towards your preferences

So far it’s been quite successful! We’ve had a few themes covered so far
1. Plays
2. Human brain
3. Books we disagree with
4. Books told from different perspectives
5. Break the fourth wall
6. Books you can read in a day

But we also have a huge host of theme ideas
1. Biographies
2. Airport books
3. Great books that are fatally flawed
4. Take place in a single day
5. Widely loved, you hated it
6. You loved it, most hate it
7. Guilty pleasures

...And many more.
