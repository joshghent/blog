Despite web search providing an interface to a wealth of human knowledge, one thing that it can't crack is finding cool stuff. And that's mainly because cool is relative and hard to quantify.

I've stumbled across a bunch of cool sites across the web that you might not have heard of.

If you have suggestions, submit a pull request on this blog!

Where possible, I've attempted to categorize them. Enjoy!
