A long time ago ~~in a galaxy far far away~~ some coworkers and I started a site called Crisp Rater. If you couldn't tell by the title, the premise was to rate various brands of crisps and flavours.

It's an incredibly british past time to both consume crisps and to think their importance is significant enough to rate them. But then again, we were all british.

Since then, in line with building my digital garden, I wanted to build a small page on my website dedicated to crisps.

Specifically, I wanted to follow the S-tier list format. Here we go:

S tier

- Picked onion monster munch - god tier, you are important enough to not care if others smell your breath. It's a sign of dominance not shame.
- Scampi fries -
- Thai sweet chilli sensations - posh but tasty

A tier

- Beef hullahoops - all other flavours are trash but the beef is good
- Wheat crunchies -
- Kettle chips (esp the sweet chilli) - fancy but amazing with a pint
- Pringles - I'm convinced they put crack in them
- Nacho cheese Doritos

B tier

- Walkers Salt and vinegar -
- Space raiders - b-tec monster much
- Skips - melt in your mouth but mostly air
- Sun bites sour cream and chive - mostly air but tasty

C tier

- Quavers - cheesy goodness but not that artificial
- McCoys - crisps are the size of a babies head and all flavours taste the same
- Chipsticks

D tier

- Watsites - guaranteed to make no one like you with cheesy fingers
- Walkers Prawn Cocktail -
- Nik Naks
- French fries - eating them is like getting a hook to the face

E tier

- Disco - 1960's much?
- Tyralls - poncy "sea salt and malt aged vinegar" rubbish
- Pom bears - mostly air and lies
- Oven baked Walkers - mostly burnt
- Frazelles - if they have ever even seen a pig I'd be surprised

F tier

- Salt and shake - I don't want to make my own meal
- Walkers max - literally always a disappointment when you get these for your meal deal
