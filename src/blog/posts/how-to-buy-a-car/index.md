Buying a used car can be pretty nerve wrecking.

As I recently did this, I wanted to record a brief checklist that can be used before buying a used cars.

1. **Check that both keys work including the physical ones**. Sometimes the second key for a car will be able to open the car but not allow it to drive. If they don't both work, it could be a sign the car is stolen.
2. Check the Spare tyre or flat tyre kit.
3. No leaks underneath
4. Tyre tread
5. Brake pads
6. turning the wheel both ways, inspect tie rods and ball joints
7. Interior functions work
8. Service history
9. Do a HPI check
10. Check the dealers reviews
11. Take out warranty
12. Pay a mechanic to come with you to check the car or take it to a mechanic afterwards.
