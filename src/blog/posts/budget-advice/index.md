title: Most budget advice is backwards

Most budget advice goes something like this:
1. Track income
2. Define how much you need to save for short and long term goals
3. Create a budget based on fixed expenses, savings and discretionary funds

The problem here is that it's not based on the brass tax of what you spend on things.

I decided therefore to review the past 5 years of spending and recalculate a budget that breaks things down to regular monthly payments.
