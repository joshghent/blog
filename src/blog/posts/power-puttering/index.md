You know those tiny jobs you never think to do until you’re sat on the loo with no paper? Yeah me too.

To solve those tiny jobs that don’t deserve dedicated time, I decided to start bundling them together into a sort of power hour - hence Power Puttering.

I schedule this power puttering time when I know I have some time free and I do the following (not every week)

- Refill all the toilet rolls in bathrooms
- Review all PR’s created by Repowarden
- Empty household bins in offices and other rooms
- Water the house plants
- Clean and maintain the vacuum
- Send invoices to clients
- Set the dishwasher to a clean cycle
- Update my wife’s computer
- Update my computer
- Update any other technology things
- Filter my email
- Stock coats and cars with tissues, antibacterial, doggie bags, chewing gum etc
- Sharpen the kitchen knives
- Refill our tea bag thing (we buy the bags in bulk)
- Refill our rice, lentils, pasta, flour and other things (again we buy in bulk)
- Fix any tech issues
- Tighten handles
- WD-40 Handles
- Charge batteries - Apple TV, mouse, keyboard, doorbell, lights etc.
- Clean the coffee machine
- Floss
- Update servers

Maybe others have certain things like this. But I quite like the regularity of this quiet system to keep things going.
