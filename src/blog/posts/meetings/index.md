I've been thinking a lot about meetings lately. I believe a majority of developers resent meetings - myself included. But, I've been thinking about why this is and what we can do to make meetings better.

## Are all meetings bad?

If you spend any time reading tech blogs, you'll probably stumble across some SaaS company who scrap all meetings or goes totally "async". It's tempting to want to implement this philosphy at your own company. The problem is that like most advice, there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. It has to be tailored. What works for them, will not work for you.

Meetings have a bit of a bad reputation. You picture a stuffy boardroom filled with people who don't want to be there, being asking questions about the work they are doing. This category of meetings are pointless.

## Why meetings happen

- managers don’t trust staff or have to keep them accountable
- Easy to call meetings
- "Feels like work"
- Work is more complex and bloated
- Peoples written communication isn't great

## How to make meetings better

- be honest if people aren’t doing their work
- Keep discussion close to where the work happens (Confluence docs, GitHub issues etc)
- Foster a culture to reject meetings with no clear outcomes
- Keep teams small
