description: A review of Skunk Works by Ben R Rich
---

Skunk Works was an elite division of Lockheed Martin who designed a number of hugely significant military aircraft between 1939 to 1978.

They were known for planes like the U-2 bomber and the SR-71 Blackbird. The stories of building both are documented in this book.

Reading Ben Rich's book gives you the impression of this "all american" type of guy. The type of person that likely hosted a BBQ every weekend in the summer and had a meticulously kept lawn.

The book contains lots of entertaining stories and displays of engineering prowess. I found it a hugely interesting book digging into the hard work and thought that went into these revolutionary designs. And I sighed when hearing the tales of bureaucratic red tape.
