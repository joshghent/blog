Updates

- Added sensitivity options, wanted lots of user control here, so split out the options into individual components. Will refine this later to add a "recommended" or "extreme" options.![Screenshot 2023-02-06 at 19.07.40](/Users/joshghent/Projects/blog/content/assets/images/Screenshot 2023-02-06 at 19.07.40.png)
- Removed how it works page because need to focus on shipping for now.
- Added some toasts to confirm when the settings save on the accounts page.
- Now time to add this to the function itself.
