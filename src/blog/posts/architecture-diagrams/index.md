description:
date: 2024-05-02
---

- Info - key, author, legend, version history
- Flow diagrams
- VPC and markings
- Services wrapped up
- Understand the different scopes - overarching be more general "image service" but a more indepth diagram would include the components or even the classes of that service etc.
- Organise it from right to left or top to bottom
- Try to avoid the mess of arrows
- Use the C4 Model
- Mark clear domain and service boundaries
- Add interaction comments
- Record questions asked about the diagram, along with the diagram
- Record an explanation of the diagram
- Have both short term and long term vision for the architecture
