  <h2>My blog is my brain</h2>
  <blockquote>I believe that reading and writing are the most nourishing forms of meditation anyone has so far found. - Kurt Vonnegut</blockquote>
  <p>I strongly resonate with Vonneguts thoughts on writing. I believe that writing about a topic is powerful tool for learning. So, this blog is a record of things I have learned or been thinking deeply about. Largely, I write for myself. Although I love the idea that other people read my writing, the words are meant to capture my mind at a certain point in time. I can then travel back in time by reviewing the archive of this page.</p>
