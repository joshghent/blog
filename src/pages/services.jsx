          <h1>Let's work together</h1>

          <p>I am a business-minded <strong>full stack engineer</strong> and <strong>solutions architect</strong> with <strong>over 7 years</strong> of professional experience. I thrive in building robust high-quality software and designing scalable cloud native solutions.</p>
          <p>Software development is complex ‚ûø, cloud bills are sky high üí∏, and bugs keep happening üêõ.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, I can help üôã</p>

          <p>As a freelancer, I offer four types of services.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Software Development</strong>. Having been a software developer for 7+ years, I have the experience of building projects from the ground up, improving existing systems, and breaking down large systems into microservices.</li>
            <li><strong>Solutions Architecture</strong>. I can help you design and implement reliable architectures that can handle millions of customers and new features.</li>
            <li><strong>Website Performance Consultancy</strong>. This involves in-depth analysis of your website for performance and accessibility issues. Afterwards, I will work with your development team to implement the fixes.</li>
            <li><strong>DevOps and Automation</strong>. Using Infrastructure-as-code tools and CI Pipeline tools, I can save your development team time, catch bugs before your customers and create reuseable systems.</li>
          </ul>

          {/* <h2>Working with me</h2>
          <p>I believe good design and communication is the key to solving lots of problems. Therefore, when programming I strive for <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>maintainability</strong>; writing code for humans rather than computers. I have a (healthy) obsession with automation so that teams have more time to do high-value work and run smoothly.</p>

          <p>I am big believer in documentation to communicate ideas, foster discussions and make decisions. Often, you will see me writing down my progress, asking for feedback, and favouring asynchronous discussions on a document rather than a synchronous meeting. </p>

          <h2>Technology and Tools</h2>
          <p>Primarily, I work in the <strong>Javascript</strong> ecosystem.</p>

          <p>My frontend technology of choice is NextJS</p>

          <p>My backend technology of choice is Node with Express</p>

          <p>AWS</p>

          <p>Design system: Tailwind</p>
