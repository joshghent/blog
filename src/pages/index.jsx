              <h1>Lowering your AWS Bills</h1>
              <p>No one likes big bills, least of all when you're not sure where they came from. I can help by diving into your infrastructure and producing a comprehensive and actionable report to help you lower you bill by 20% or more.</p>
              <p>You might feel like your AWS Bill is like a black hole, not sure what's in there and will probably hurt you if you go near it - with my in-depth analysis I will guarantee to save you far more than AWS rightsizing recommendations or any other infrastructure analysis tool.</p>
              <p>You can get the peace of mind of knowing what your paying for and why you're paying for it. Most importantly, we help you scale your business whilst flat-lining your bill.</p>

            <div className="resiliency">
              <h1>Make your platform rock solid</h1>
              <p>Early on, resiliency and scaling are an after thought for us all. But as your business grows, people complain, developers tear their hair out and everyone is left unhappy.</p>
              <p>I can help you make your new or existing platform more resilient with my years of experience building systems integrated with hundreds of third parties.</p>
              <p>I will mentor your developers to become resiliency rockstars so you can build and maintain a solid platform.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="automation">
              <h1>Automation - less Terminator, more Wall-E</h1>
              <p>Ever feel like you've done this same task over and over again? Or do hear your developers complain how difficult releasing new builds is? Or how long it takes?</p>
              <p>I can provide the expertise to automate your software testing and delivery pipelines. Saving thousands of hours of manual QA time whilst increasing developer productivity.</p>
              <p>Software testing and continuous integration can often seem inaccessible and expensive, but with my guidance your business can ship quality product, faster.</p>
